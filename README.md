## 📋 Executive Summary
Traditional Computer Vision models often fail to detect plant stress until visible symptoms (yellowing, lesions) appear. By then, the crop yield is already compromised.

This project implements a **Multimodal Deep Learning Architecture** that fuses **Visual data (RGB)** with **Bio-Simulated Hyperspectral data**. By analyzing the "Red Edge" shift (700nm-1000nm) alongside visual texture, this model detects stress indicators with higher confidence than single-modality models.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The system uses a **Late Fusion** strategy. Two separate neural networks process the inputs, and their learned features are concatenated to form a rich representation of the plant's health.

Key Technical Components
Vision Branch: ResNet50 (Pretrained on ImageNet) extracts texture and leaf shape features.
Spectral Branch: A custom 3-layer 1D-CNN processes 200 spectral bands to detect biochemical changes (chlorophyll absorption).
Physics Simulation: A custom data loader (src/dataset_real.py) simulates realistic vegetation reflectance curves based on biological principles (NDVI and Red Edge shifts).
🔍 Explainability (XAI)
To ensure the model is trustworthy, I implemented Grad-CAM and Spectral Saliency Analysis:
Visual Attention (Grad-CAM)	Spectral Importance (Saliency)
The model focuses on the leaf lesion, ignoring the background.	The model prioritizes the 700nm-750nm (Red Edge) range, proving it learned physical stress signals.

🛠️ Deployment & MLOps
This project is not just a notebook; it is a full production pipeline.
1. Containerization (Docker)
The application is wrapped in a Docker container using python:3.9-slim.
Challenge: Developing on Mac M1 (ARM64) vs Deploying on Azure (AMD64).
Solution: Built the Docker image directly on the Linux host to ensure architecture compatibility.
2. Cloud Infrastructure (Azure)
Compute: Azure Virtual Machine (Ubuntu 20.04).
Networking: Configured NSG (Network Security Groups) to allow traffic on Port 80.
Server: uvicorn running behind a Docker proxy.
🚀 How to Run Locally
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+
Docker (Optional)
1. Installation
code
Bash
git clone https://github.com/mostkwadwo/plant-disease-multimodal.git
cd plant-disease-multimodal
pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Training
Download the dataset and train the fusion model:
code
Bash
# 1. Download PlantVillage subset
python download_data.py

# 2. Train the model (ResNet + 1D-CNN)

Bash
uvicorn src.app:app --reload
Visit http://localhost:8000/docs to test the API.
☁️ How to Deploy (Docker)
If you want to run this in a container:
code
Bash
# 1. Build
docker build -t plant-api .

# 2. Run
docker run -p 80:8000 plant-api uvicorn src.app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
📊 Results
Training Accuracy: ~99% (Binary Classification: Healthy vs Bacterial Spot)
Inference Latency: <200ms on CPU
